  overview: >
    A fast-paced local multiplayer game for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I developed this game for fun with some friends from work. It got picked up and published by Square-Enix.
    I worked on a bunch of things:
      * Game programming (in particular animation programming, gameplay, audio and UI)
      * Level design
      * Character concepts

    Game design was a collaborative effort, of course.
